# gcode-comments
A node command-line tool (CLI) for auto-adding comments to a GCODE file

This is a Node.js file written in JavaScript which will open the indicated GCODE file and create a new one with comments. Each comment will be based upon the type of [RepRap field command](http://reprap.org/wiki/G-code#Fields) which is seen.

## Installation
It is suggested that the script file be placed somewhere in your path so that you don't have to indicate where to find it (as seen below).

Note that `gcode-comments` expects the GCODE file to be in the current working direction, however.

```
$ cd sites
$ git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/OutsourcedGuru/gcode-comments
$ cd gcode-comments
$ chmod a+x gcode-comments
# Copy a GCODE file into this folder, then:
$ ./gcode-comments file.gcode
